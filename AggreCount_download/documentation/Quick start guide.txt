AggreCount quick start guide
1.	Download the Aggrecount macro
  a.	Install via the plugin menu “Install…” option
  b.	Or drag and drop onto the ImageJ toolbar to open in the macro editor
2.	Place all images for analysis into one folder
  a.	All images should have the same channels in the same order
3.	Run Aggrecount from either the plugin menu or the “Run” button in the macro editor
4.	Select the folder with images for analysis
5.	Select “Setup”
6.	Follow instructions to designate nuclei, aggregate, and cell body channels
  a.	If there is no cell body stain, select nuclei channel
7.	Select “Get image” to adjust threshold (applied to all images during analysis)
  a.	Choose an image and adjust threshold
  b.	Continue until satisfied with threshold
    i.	Press “Next step”
8.	Select “Get image” to view aggregate size and distance from nucleus
  a.	Note size of noise vs signal for size cut off
  b.	Note distance from nuclear perimeter
    i.	This distance designates the perinuclear zone
  c.	Press “Next step”
9.	Select “Get image” to view different cell body processing methods and strictness
  a.	Note method and strictness from image titles
  b.	Press “Next step (settings)”
10.	Main settings window
  a.	Threshold values are auto-populated from setup
  b.	Adjust perinuclear distance, aggregate min/max levels as previously noted
  c.	Adjust strictness of cell body processing and method as previously noted
  d.	Adjust other settings as desired (see below for explanations)
  e.	Batch mode
    i.	Unchecked
      1.	Macro will pause after acquiring ROIs and show user
      2.	Useful to ensure fidelity of processing and ROI capture before running a batch mode analysis
    ii.	Checked
      1.	Macro will proceed to analyze all images in folder in the background
      2.	Useful when processing an entire experiment
11.	Data files will be saved after all images have been analyzed in the folder selected
  a.	Look for “AC_analysis#” folder
