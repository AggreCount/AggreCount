# AggreCount is an automated image analysis macro written in the ImageJ macro language for the quantification and localization of aggregates on a subcellular level. AggreCount is designed to quantify and localize puncta using proximity to a nuclear immunohistochemical stain (eg Hoechst) to determine location. This macro may be utilized out of the box with FIJI version 1.52p or later without additional downloads. Simply download the macro, open in FIJI, and hit 'run'. The macro will lead you through setup steps before allowing batch analysis of images. The quick start guide has detailed steps and trouble shooting tips for new users.
